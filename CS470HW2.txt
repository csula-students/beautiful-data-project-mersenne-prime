1. What question(s) did you decide to work on as a team? 
	
	- Our question is "how can we detect and classify audio signals". 
	- We will be working on the DCASE2016 challlenge task 1: http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/task-acoustic-scene-classification
	
2. What is your data source(s)? 

	- Our dataset is a set of 30 second recordings of acoustic scenes. With that initial data set, we parse those audio recordings to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)

3. How long does it take for you to download data? Have you downloaded complete data set?

	- Screenshot attatched to repo
	- To download the entire set, it took me about an hour. 
	- Yes, we do have the complete data set. 
	
4. How large is your data (size wise and number of records wise)?
	- 7.5GB in size (audio files)
	- 1013 records (audio files), this should mean 1013 rows of MFCC values as well. 

5. Do you face any dirty data issue? If you do, how did you clean up your data? 
	- I don't think we have any dirty data. The audio files we get should be complete. It's possible that our 
	MFCC data might have some dirty data but we'll have to see.
	
	- If we do get incomplete, inaccurate, or erroneous MFCC data, our cean up process will probably be a matter 
	of troubleshooting our data extraction process. 

6. How do you store the data you downloaded? 

	- Audio files are just saved on our local devices. The MFCC values are stored in MongoDB
