# Audio Signal Detection and Classification

##Dependencies

Currently using this library for mfcc but might change it to own functions:

http://python-speech-features.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

The library is installed via github:

https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features

Also requires numpy and pymongo, these can be installed via pip

##File structure

Required File Structure is to make directory:

datasets/

Inside datasets untar datafiles from Task2:

##Information

The feature vectors being used are Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficents (MFCC),
commonly used in speech recognition, this is a good explaination:
